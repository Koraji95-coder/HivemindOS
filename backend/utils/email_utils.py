email_utils.py ðŸ“§
------------------
Email-sending utilities for auth (verification, reset, alerts).
Uses SendGrid API, but can easily be adapted for other providers.

# Usage:
from backend.utils.email_utils import send_verification_email, send_reset_email
send_verification_email("user@email.com", "OTP123")

For dev/test, you can swap out with a print statement or add SMS/other transports.
